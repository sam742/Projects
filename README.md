# Snake Game

Python snake game is a game built on the classic concept of snake games. It is built on python 3 with the help of pygame. It is a simple 2D game which can be played on your local machine. 

## How to play the game?

To play the game on your machine, you should have python installed on your machine. You can download the python installer from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and run it on your machine to install python.

After installing python, follow these steps to run the project on your local machine

- Clone the repositary, or download it as zip and extract it
- Open your terminal and write

``` pip install pygame```

This is the command to install pygame on your machine. This project is built using pygame, hence it's a must to install pygame to run this project.

Once the pygame package is installed, navigate to the file. There are two methods for this

- You can write ```cd folder path\ python filname.py```
- Or you can also write ```python "file path"```

**Note:** Writing python is necessary because it invokes the python interpreter. And at the end of the command, don't forget to add the file extension that is ```.py``` otherwise the script won't run.

## Usage

The usage of the game is quite simple. If you follow the above instructions, the game window will appear on your screen. You just need to press any navigation button, ```Up, Down, Left, Right``` to move the snake.

If the snake touches the boundary of the window, the game will over and you'll a message *You lost! Press C to Play Again or Q to Quit.*

## Contribution

Want to contribute to the project? Here is how you can help me improve the application, and add more features. You can contribute to the project,

- By finding bugs, and telling me about them, and then you may even fix those bugs.
- By thinking of new features which can be added to the app(and telling me), and even working on those new features.

If you have such bug/feature you would like me to know about, all you need to do, is [raise an issue](https://github.com/sam742/Projects/issues). After that, we can discuss more about the issue, and then maybe you can work on solving it.
